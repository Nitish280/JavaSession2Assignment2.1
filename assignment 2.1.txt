There are so many important componenet which we use in java architecture like JDK,JRE,JVM,these all are connected with each other.
These all have to perform different different task.Java architecture is based on these important component.
First,we have to write the source code after the completion of the code java compiler compiles the  source code into byte code.
Then java virtual machine interprets this bytecode  and generates machine code which is executed by System in which java program runs.
There are so many components which is essential in java architecture like Class Loader,Byte Code verifier,Just In Time Compiler.

Class Loader-Class loader loads all the class files required to execute the program.

Byte Code Verifier-The bytecode verifier verifies the byte code.

Just In Time Compiler-It is use for the execution,JIT makes the execution faster.
